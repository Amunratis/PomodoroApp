# PomodoroApp
Even though this project doesn't seem much right now the goal is to produce a featurerich productivity time and money management app.

Roadmap for development:

-Time tracking similar to SaveMyTime. Each time the phone is unlocked there will be drawn a panel over the screen where the user is asked what she/he has been doing recently. The user can later check how much time do they spend on their activities thorought the day.
-Persistent alarms like in Alarmy + featuring dream journal + money penalty for not getting up (half an hour from the moment of getting up you'll have to prove with your mobile GPS that you are away at least 500 m from your home and thus awake, or something like that) There will also be money rewards Perhaps app should have it's own ERC20 token that would be rewarded to people sticking to their goals/habits?
-Social feature just like in runkeeper/Edomondo, it will also have a fully funtional chat app
-Each task will have it's journal/google keep note? - consider whether if using google keep note content provider will be better solution than developing your own notes module
-rendering the phone unusable during the pomodoro session, except for the notepad connected to the task and emergency calls
-working witch google callendar content provider

Feel free to suggest features, post issues/commit code/ and/or leave a donation for the development
